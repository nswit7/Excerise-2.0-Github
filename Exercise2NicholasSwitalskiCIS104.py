print("At what size of a project should you start using version management software? Why? Minimum 150 words.")

print("A version management software should be used on any size project.")

print("This is because if something happens while you're writing the code and lose progress there will always be a new version to restore to, and if you saved recently you won't lose as much progress.")

print("Different versions also help because you can see your progress throughout the days of what you accomplished per day. Along with if you're in a group each member can see who has done what and when they did it.")

print("Version Software also tracks every single change you make so if you're constantly checking if your code works and it's been working but you just added a new line and doesn't work you can know 100% that it's coming from that line you just made compared to your whole code saves time and energy.")

print("Finally a version software should be used every single time you code simply because it can catch your mistakes quicker and faster if you're taking the correct steps to debugging or creating a code, without losing progress and having to restart.")
